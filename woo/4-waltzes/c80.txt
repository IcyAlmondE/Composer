Sunflower Waltz (Waltz in F major) was composed by IcyAlmondEarth on 13th February 2022, marked Composition No.80. I first published the piece publicly on my Youtube channel on 18th February 2024 with 432Hz tuning. It's the 23rd waltz I composed.

Before I could realize, I was already a week from graduating from high school. A lot of things happened that week; the final exams, my almost failed electronics project, and the fact that I won't be sleeping and living in the same room anymore. I ended up buying a sunflower (from the school's Valentine event) to brighten my mood up. Before my high school times ended, I decided to compose the final piece at dorm; the Sunflower Waltz, inspired from that sunflower which reminds me of someone. Sitting at the balcony, I wrote the notes out. The piece was also my last piano performance I recorded at my piano corner in my room on 18th February 2024; my last day at dorm.

Sunflower Waltz consists of 5 sections, making up a ternary form A-B-A' with a short introduction and a coda. The piece starts off with the main chord progression of the piece as an introduction. The A section includes the melody with accompanied open position chords. It then modulates to B-flat major in the B section and the introduction repeats in B-flat major before returning to the A' section back to F major. The A' sections ends with a phrase played with thirds leading to the coda played with octaves. The chords in the introduction section repeats for the last time with minor chords except the root chord.

The piece marks the end of my high school era.
