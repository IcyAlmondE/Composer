Lemon Tea Waltz (Waltz in G-flat major) was composed by IcyAlmondEarth on 7th July 2023, marked Composition No.70. The piece was also published privately on 12th July 2023. It's the 20th waltz I composed.

In Japanese culture, the 7th of July is a day of Tanabata (about couple things and hanging a paper note on a bamboo tree). My high school, which is kind of Japan affliated, also had the tree set up. I wanted to compose something inspired by that, so I picked the key of G-flat major for the Japanese feeling (the pentatonic of course). I am not really sure that I did achieve that Japanese feeling though. Initially, there was no nickname for this one. I just got the name out of a glass of lemon tea I was making that evening. So yeah, the lemon tea waltz was born.

Lemon Tea Waltz consists of 3 sections, making up a ternary form A-B-A. It is the shortest piece among the 4 waltzes with only a minute long. The structural detail is similar to the Christmas Eve Waltz. The A section starts off with closed position triads and then expands to open position chords. The B section uses the extended royal road progression which can usually be found in Japanese songs. The A section comes back with only a bit of alternations at the end.
