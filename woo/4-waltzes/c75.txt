Daydream Waltz (Waltz in F-sharp major; originally Valse-Impromptu) was composed/improvised by IcyAlmondEarth on 24th September 2023, marked Composition No.75. It's the 21st waltz I composed.

It was the week of the final exam. I already spent plenty much of time on reviews so I decided to relax myself and play the piano. The Daydream Waltz was the piece I improvised that day out of sleepiness. So I guess the piece is the closest one to the point of sleeping or "dreaming", floating around nowhere.

Daydream Waltz consists of 5 sections, making up a ternary form A-B-A' with a short introduction and a codetta. The introdution plays the kind of alternated melody of the main theme in a floating feeling. The A section plays the main theme with rubato, accompanied with open position waltz rhythm chords. The piece modulates to C-sharp minor for a short while in the B section. The A' section returns with a bit of alternation (because it's improvised and my memory slipped) similarly to how dream works. The piece concludes with a codetta, still in a floating feeling, and chord intervals rising up towards the end.
