                    <p>4 Waltzes is a collection of short waltzes composed at my dorm room during my high school times between December 2022 and February 2024.

                        <p>Christmas Eve Waltz (Waltz in E major) was composed by IcyAlmondEarth on 24th December 2022, marked Composition No.55. I first published the piece privately on 25th December 2022 and exactly two years later on 25th December 2024 it became public. Despite being the 2nd waltz I published, it's actually the 17th waltz I composed.</p>
                        <p>The Christmas Eve that year was the first day of the new year break. Most of other students had already left dorm, so the dorm was left really quiet. The recording of my "17 sai no uta" cover was done on that day, too. While waiting to be picked up, I sat at the piano and wanted to make a piece that resembles the atmosphere; a nice and tranquil dorm room with a cool wind from the balcony. I was kind of into Takashi Yoshimatsu at that time, so I took the inspiration from his "Waltz in Green" and the piece was composed and finished on that same day. The piece was recorded on the next morning.</p>
                        <p>Christmas Eve Waltz consists of 5 sections, making up a ternary form A-B-A' with an introduction and a codetta. The introduction includes high arpeggiated chords and a winter-like melody. The A section starts off with the melody and a closed position triads doing the waltz rhythm which later expands to open position chords. The melody of the B section is played with thirds. The A section comes back with a more majestic repetition, leading to the end of the piece. The piece ends with a codetta with a similar feeling to the introduction.</p>
